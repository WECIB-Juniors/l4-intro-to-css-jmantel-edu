    <h1>How to create a fun dice game in Python</h1>
    <h2>Jordan Mantel</h2>

    <p>In this Python tutorial, we'll be making a fun dice game, similar to fun roguelike deckbuilder games that have been popping up. We won't be using anything other than the terminal this time, so no need to know a display library like Pygame or Raylib. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Setup</li>
        <li>Creating the Die object</li>
        <li>Creating the Battle object</li>
        <li>Creating the Shop scene</li>
        <li>Buying from the Shop</li>
        <li>Creating the Upgrade Chance scene</li>
        <li>Game Over and Wrapping Up</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Step 1: Setup</h1>
    <h2>Mostly just getting the Python file set up. Nothing very difficult.</h2>
    <p>To start with, create a new folder, title it whatever you'd like (I'm titling mine diceGame.) Given that this is a dice game, we'll of course want to import random.</p>
    <p class="code">import random</p>
    <p>Next, let's make the deck.</p>
    <p class="code">deck = []</p>
    <p>And the game loop.</p>
    <p class="code">running = True 

while running: 
    # Next Battles Preview 
    # Battle Scene 
    # Get Rewards & Upgrade Chance 
    # Shop Scene 
    pass 
</p>
<p>This is basically it for setup, so let's move onto making the Die object.</p>
<h1>Step 2: Creating the Die Object</h1>
<h2>Creating a die that can be rolled.</h2>
<p>Create a new script in your editor called "die.py". The files open in your editor should look something like this:</p>
